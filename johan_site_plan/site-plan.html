      <h3>My experience</h3>
      <p>
        Why will people come to your site? 
        We as humansâ€™ trend to compare our self and this comparations could be of 2 kinds, constructive which is when we have uncertainty of our performance, or we maybe fill a little lost in a assignment and need to see someone else to find out what they did right and wrong and learn from them.
        The other type of comparation that is not so pleasant is when we use it to steal ideas or maybe judge someone else work having this is mind, I hope future students can see this page and see any mistake I may commit and learn from them our rescue the things that I do right and apply to their own projects.

      <h3>activitys</h3>
      <p>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? 
        Each individual has a completely different perspective and experience out of the same class and each one will affect one way or another to other people because some could feel more identifies with one or other. 
        Not much information will be need it just whatever the commenter wants to share.
